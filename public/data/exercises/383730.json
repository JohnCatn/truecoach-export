{"exercises":[{"id":383730,"default":false,"exercise_name":"Bulgarian Split Squat","description":"Stand facing away from a bench, sofa, or appropriate stable surface, with your upper calf touching the object.\nTake a big stride forwards with one leg. Planting the toes forwards or slightly outward.\n\nStraighten your front leg, brace the core and stare at the floor or bottom of the wall 2 metres in front of you (importantly, a surface or object that isnâ€™t moving).\n\nNow, keeping the shoulders relaxed, lift your back leg and place the foot/ankle on the bench. Balance by weighting and straightening the front leg.\n\nMake sure you are staring at the same point, breathe in and descent smoothly until the thigh is parallel with the ground.\nAs you drive back up through the front leg, brace the knee outwards to prevent it caving across the body. Your knee caving will load the quad and disable good posture and glute activation.\n\nBreathe out as you squeeze the bum at the peak, balance if needs be and repeat.\n","attachments":[],"trainer_id":26589,"organization_id":24837,"tags":{"type":[],"primary_muscles":[],"plane":[],"pattern":[]},"url":"https://youtu.be/wTs7rwjd7Ps"}]}
