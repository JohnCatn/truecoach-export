{"exercises":[{"id":384208,"default":false,"exercise_name":"Tricep Dips","description":"Position your hands shoulder-width apart on a secured bench or stable chair.\nStraighten your arms, keeping a little bend in your elbows to keep tension on your triceps and off your elbow joints.\nSlowly bend your elbows to lower your body toward the floor until your elbows are at about a 90-degree angle. Be sure to keep your back close to the bench.\nOnce you reach the bottom of the movement, press down into the bench to straighten your elbows, returning to the starting position. This completes one rep.\nKeep your shoulders down as you lower and raise your body. You can bend your legs to modify this exercise.","attachments":[],"trainer_id":26589,"organization_id":24837,"tags":{"type":[],"primary_muscles":[],"plane":[],"pattern":[]},"url":"https://youtu.be/qYiG-7X97hc"}]}
